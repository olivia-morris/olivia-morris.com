        Hi! I'm Olivia, a digital marketing and communications professional based in California's Central Valley.
        As Social Media and Marketing Producer for CSU Stanislaus' student newspaper, The Signal, I optimized content
        performance and drove website conversions through targeted social campaigns.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've since applied growth strategies across nonprofit outreach and e-commerce, currently focusing on SEO
        and live sales engagement for a local boutique. I lead with storytelling and brand narrative,
        then use data to amplify reach and drive results across digital platforms.
